    "## Bassel's Correction \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bessel's correction** is a statistical formula that adjusts the sample standard deviation to more accurately reflect the population standard deviation. The formula involves dividing the sum of squared deviations by `(n-1)` instead of `n`, where `n` is the `sample size`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the data is from the mean value, and is calculated as the square root of the sum of squared deviations from the mean, divided by the number of observations minus one `(n-1)` for a sample, or just n for a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for using Bessel's correction is to account for the fact :\n",
    ">That the `sample standard deviation` tends to underestimate the `population standard deviation`, especially for `small sample sizes`. By using `(n-1)` instead of `n` in the denominator, Bessel's correction increases the value of the sample standard deviation, making it a better estimate of the population standard deviation.\n"
